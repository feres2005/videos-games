		In the celebrated, controversial essays gathered here, Olu Oguibe exposes the disparities of the treatment
		afforded Western and non-Western artists. Ranging from the impact of the West’s appetite for difference on
		global cultural relations and the existence of a digital Third World to the African redefinition of modernity,
		Oguibe’s uncompromising criticism provides a global vision of contemporary art and culture.
		<h2>whats the best videos games?</h2>
		<h4>10: Super Mario 64
			Released 1996</h4>
		<img src="RES/mario.jpg"><br>
		<p>Mario games are synonymous with fun and innovation, and perhaps Mario 64 is the best example of the latter.
			It gathered the core elements of Mario’s best 2D, side-scrolling adventures and worked out how to translate
			them into a groundbreaking 3D world. It was still recognisably Mario – he collected mushrooms and ran and
			jumped his way to success, but he was forever changed. He could now long jump, triple jump, and backflip.
			While the underlying challenge remained the same and the locations were reassuringly familiar, the shift in
			perspective changed everything.<br>
			What’s even more impressive is that Mario did not simply enter a new dimension with ease, he did it with
			style that few games unburdened with such technical challenges ever achieve. Mario 64 might now look a
			little blocky but it remains bold and brilliant, too.</p>
		<h4>09 :Red Dead Redemption
			Released 2010</h4>
		<img src="RES/red.jpg"><br>
		<p> If you're reading this list and haven't played Red Dead Redemption, go find yourself a copy of the game and
			the appropriate console to play it on. Right now. We'll wait the 30+ hours – this is important.<br>

			2008's GTA 4 may have been the reason that I bought an Xbox 360, but RDR is the reason I kept it. Not only
			did I get completely lost in the massive single-player world, to the point where I'd started talking with a
			bit of a drawl because I was so used to hearing it, but it also drew me into online gaming unlike anything
			I'd played before. Sure, CoD was fun for a bit and racing games were okay, but never before had I so
			successfully crafted my own stories and adventures (with friends and strangers alike) than in Red Dead's
			Free Roam mode.<br>

			It was the kind of game you couldn't wait to discuss with your friends the next day. "Did you save that
			woman on the train tracks?" "No, but I found this cabin that had, like, 1,000 cougars in it," "That's cool,
			but did you kill Sasquatch?" Everyone had their own amazing tales to tell about their time in the old west,
			and you were constantly making new ones every time you turned it on. The only real downside to Red Dead is
			that it never came out on PC – which is mostly sad because my 360 died years ago and I really want to play
			it again.<br></p>
		<h4>08 :Half-Life 2
			Released 2004</h4>
		<img src="RES/half.jpg"><br>
		<p>Half-Life 2 forever changed our expectations for what a first-person shooter could be. Its richly imagined
			world and wonderfully paced gameplay is a delight, never letting up and brimming with invention. The Gravity
			Gun is obviously the poster child of Half-Life 2, turning each environment into a tactile playground in
			which you can create improvised weapons and solve basic but clever physics puzzles - and its importance
			can’t be overstated - but there’s an awful lot more here.<br>

			We’re introduced to Alyx Vance, a supporting character with a rare warmth and intelligence. We’re
			transported to an iconic city, where Combine barricades loom with grim authority, and Striders stalk the
			streets with an otherworldly menace. We get to set Antlions on our enemies and in which we play fetch with a
			robot Dog. In short, it is a truly memorable piece of game design.<br></p>
		<h4>07: Tetris
			Released 1984</h4>
		<img src="RES/tetris.jpg"><br>
		<p>The classic Russian title-matching puzzle game by Alexey Pajitnov blew my mind way back in the day. Even as a
			little girl, I was obsessed with Tetris. I’d never played a video game that mentally stimulating, let alone
			that addictive.

			I still remember spending hours sitting in front of the TV with the Nintendo Entertainment System sitting at
			my feet, rotating brightly colored puzzle pieces as they fell from the abyss, attempting to arrange them
			into horizontal lines that when assembled correctly would disappear and cause me to advance to the next
			stage. It was crazy fun, even when blocks began to fall at an alarmingly fast pace and I fell into a
			frenzied panic. (I still remember how frustrated I’d get making careless mistakes that resulted in giant,
			pixelated Towers of Pisa.)<br>

			But no matter how many times I had to start the game over, it was just too much fun to stop. There was
			always the chance that this time I’d get the right puzzle piece at the right time and could move on to the
			next stage. I never got tired of it, and even now Tetris remains one of my favorite games of all time.<br>
		</p>

		<h4>06 :Super Mario Bros. 3
			Released 1998</h4>
		<img src="RES/mario2.jpg"><br>
		<p>As a kid, I played almost any game that had a cool character on the box or starred my beloved Ninja Turtles.
			But even then, although I lacked the vocabulary to explain it, I knew that Super Mario Bros. was special,
			and better than almost everything else. So when I received Super Mario Bros. 3 from Santa one year, and saw
			on the back of the box that Mario could fly, I knew I was in for something special.

			The game exceeded my every hope and wish for it, and I spent hundreds of blissful afternoons defeating Koopa
			Kids, rescuing kings, and discovering secrets strewn throughout Mushroom World. Mario 3 earned a place on my
			list of favorite games way back in 1990, and 25 years of gaming progress have yet to dislodge it.

			Super Mario Bros. 3 is a textbook example of how to make a perfect video game sequel. It’s a mixture of the
			original’s best elements, combined with an almost excessive amount of imaginative new ideas. So much of what
			we consider so quintessentially Mario – the suits, the boos, the overworld – all actually originated
			here.<br></p>

		<h4>05 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
			Released 2017</h4>
		<img src="RES/legende.jpg"><br>
		<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild eschewed the semi-linear, borderline predictable path of the 3D Zelda
			games before it in favor of a bold, crazy new approach: let players do what they want, how they want, and in
			whatever order they decide.

			By marrying an open-ended approach to quest structure with the ability to freely explore a vast, beautiful,
			intriguing world with little specific regulation, the 3D Zelda game template was shattered about as fast as
			the average breakable weapon in Breath of the Wild. The result is a gorgeous, freeing open-world
			action/adventure experience that evokes the wonder and fear of exploring a bold new place with the
			empowering tangibility of becoming its hero.<br></p>
		<h4>04: Super Metroid
			Released 1994</h4>
		<img src="RES/super.jpg"><br>
		<p>Super Metroid’s minimalistic environmental storytelling set a bar, way back in 1994, that I believe has still
			yet to be eclipsed. The planet Zebes is atmospheric, oppressive, and extremely lethal. At first glance,
			there doesn’t even appear to be any story. But then you start to look more closely. The parasite-riddled
			dead soldier outside of an early boss room. The crashed, half-submerged alien spaceship that may or may not
			be haunted. The techno lair of the space pirates hiding under your nose the entire game. It’s brilliant and
			confident. It doesn’t explain to you what each new area is all about. It’s all there, for you to figure out
			(or ignore) on your own.<br>

			But it’s Super Metroid’s ability to consistently invite the player to be curious – and then rewarding that
			curiosity – that makes it one of the greatest video games ever made. It’s not just that there are secrets
			hidden everywhere (although there are, and it’s awesome) – it’s that the game teases you with tantalizing
			clues – items, always just out of reach. An energy tank embedded in a seemingly impassable wall. A pair of
			missiles only obtainable from the collapsing blocks above, leaving you no idea of how to get up there, just
			with the knowledge that you can get up there.<br>

			Super Metroid is an impeccable action-platformer – that’s the “easy” part. What makes it truly special is
			its genius combination of puzzle-solving, atmosphere, storytelling, exploration, game design, and gameplay.
			There’s nothing else like <br></p>
		<h4>03 :Portal 2
			Released 2011</h4>
		<img src="RES/robot.jpg"><br>
		<p>Portal undoubtedly came out of nowhere and shattered the mold, but Portal 2 took that raw and incredible
			concept and managed to shape it into a more polished and impressive package. It cranked the dials up on just
			about everything that made the original so special. The mind-bending puzzles, the surprisingly dark story,
			and the ridiculous humor that balanced it out - each piece of that picture was refined and refreshed to
			build a sequel that actually surpassed the ambition of an already extremely ambitious game, making something
			both familiar and altogether new.

			It gave us a deeper look into the wonderful world of Aperture Science without completely dragging all of its
			mysteries out into the light. It also mixed its “thinking with portals” puzzles up even further by weaving
			in gel mechanics that felt entirely fresh and completely natural at the same time - while simultaneously and
			subtly using them to tie gameplay mechanics into the story, patiently waiting until its incredible finale to
			pay off those setups with one of the weirdest and most spectacular video game endings around. Couple that
			with a seriously good co-op campaign and even a full-on custom level builder and sharing systems added
			post-launch and Portal 2 has stayed the high bar by which all first-person puzzle games should be measured,
			even nearly a decade later.<br></p>
		<h4>02: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
			Released 1991</h4>
		<img src="RES/portal.jpg"><br>
		<p>The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link laid the foundations Link’s quest, but it was A Link to the
			Past that built the land of Hyrule into a world. From it’s unforgettable beginnings guiding a swordless Link
			through the rain, to the final showdown with Ganon and utilizing mastery of sword and bow to defeat evil,
			Link to the Past measured out a perfect pace of dungeons, exploration, and a gripping narrative that was
			almost unheard of at the time. It’s open landscape was always inviting but never felt aimless – striking the
			perfect balance of freedom and purpose in your quest to save Princess Zelda.

			This iteration of Hyrule was more than just moving between enemy-filled screens, it encompassed everything
			an immersive experience should be: a vast open world that teased you with secrets hiding just beyond your
			reach, begging you to come back with new and inventive tools. Each zone – whether in the cheerful overworld,
			dimly lit caves, or the intimidating Dark World – was brought to life through a culmination of details like
			the sound of the Tempered Sword cleaving the air, the catchy jingle of a puzzle well-solved, and the ambient
			tunes of Koji Kondo’s score. This version of Hyrule more than any other before or since, is the one I fell
			most in love with.<br></p>
		<h4>01 :Super Mario World
			Released 1990</h4>
		<img src="RES/mario 3.jpg"><br>
		<p> In nearly three decades no game has supplanted Super Mario World as the best game ever made... Which is
			stupid. I’ll get to that in a bit. Super Mario World is a relatively simple game to describe. It’s a Super
			Mario game, and we all know what that means: Mushrooms; perfect running and jumping action; and a giant
			world to explore, crammed with secrets.

			But what sets Super Mario World apart from other 2D Mario games is its irresistible complexity. Subsequent
			Super Mario games, like the New Super Mario Bros. series, simplified the overworld, trading Super Mario
			World’s cool hidden paths for linear tracks, largely abandoned the skies and treetops of Super Mario World’s
			vertical levels for ground-based obstacle courses, and did away with flying almost entirely (capes rule,
			helicopter hats drool!). Super Mario World is the crescendo to the slow build in technology and game design
			that started with Super Mario Bros. And that crescendo featured a cool, simulated 90s slap bass track.

			So look, we want to play a better game than Super Mario World. There’s no great, existential reason for
			Super Mario World to remain at the top of IGN’s list. Let Super Mario World’s placement on this list be a
			challenge to future game developers. We dare you to make a better game: Puzzling, but not opaque; tough but
			not intimidating; beautiful, funny, joyful, and universally recognizable. And, while we have your attention,
			dinosaurs are always a plus.</p>

		<p>top earning gamers
			Settling on the fourth spot is Bulgarian player Ivan “MinD_ContRoL” Ivanov.

			Occupying the third spot is Polish-Jordanian player Amer “Miracle-“ Al-Barqawi, who gained critical
			attention after toppling Romanian player Aliwi “w33” Omar from the Dota 2 European leaderboards.

			After reaching the top, Al-Barqawi was recruited at (monkey) Business, now OG, which served as a springboard
			for his rise to fame.

			A prodigy of sorts, Al-Barqawi garnered a massive following for his high-level performances as a mid and
			safelane player for OG. This boosted even more when he became the first player in the world to reach 9k MMR.

			Despite transferring to Team Liquid after The International 2016, Al-Barqawi maintained winning tournaments.
			He currently has seven championships under his belt: The Frankfurt Major 2015, The Manila Major 2016, ESL

		<h4>2. Johan “n0tail” Sundstein</h4>

		<img src="RES/notail.jpg">
		<p>top earning gamers
			Landing on the second spot is Danish player Johan “n0tail” Sundstein, who has long been in the esports scene
			since his Heroes of Newerth days.

			He made a name for himself in several HoN online tournaments, under team Fnatic. He also won consecutive LAN
			tournaments such as the DreamHack.

			In his transition to Dota 2, along with Fnatic teammates such as Tal “Fly” Aizik and Adrian “Era” Kryeziu,
			Sundstein was able to be part of upper seed teams in tournaments, albeit not winning championships.

			Sundstein joined Team Secret in 2014, which won the XMG Captains Draft 2.0.

			He then soon founded OG, formerly (monkey) Business, in 2015, the first Dota 2 team to ever hold four Major
			titles: Frankfurt, Manila, Boston, and Kiev.

			OG was incapable to participate in the China Dota 2 Supermajor due to Aizik’s and Gustav “s4” Magnusson’s
			sudden departure, leaving the team only a few weeks’ time to prepare for The International 2018 Open
			Qualifiers (the “most bottom” of the tournament).

			However, they still managed to emerge as champions after a rough 3-2 finish vs. PSD-LGD mainly through
			“comeback” games. As a result, Sundstein’s earnings are currently sitting at $3,733,970.56.</p><br>

		<h4>1. Kuro “KuroKy” Takhasomi</h4>

		<img src="RES/bouderhem.jpg"><br>
		<p>top earning gamersGerman player Kuro “KuroKy” Takhasomi still wears the crown for being the highest earning
			gamer in the world, as of 2018, with a whopping total winnings of $4,097,926.95.

			Since Defense of the Ancients, or the so-called Dota 1, Takhasomi was already playing competitively under
			mousesports in 2008. At one event, he met Estonian player Clement “Puppey” Ivanov, who will be greatly
			influential in his esports career.

			During the Dota 2 adaptation, Takhasomi’s early days were not much successful with teams such as
			GosuGamers.net, PANZER, and 10,000th.

			He soon settled with Natus Vincere in 2013, alongside legendary players such as Oleksandr “XBOCT”
			Dashkevych, Gleb “Funn1k” Lipatnikov, Danil “Dendi” Ishutin, and Ivanov, landing second place at The
			International that year in a tooth and nail five-game series against Alliance.

			He continued seeking greener pastures at Team Secret in 2014 as the carry, but was only partly successful by
			winning second at the Star Ladder despite his stellar performances. After some roster changes, he went back
			to playing support and paved way for the team to win some LAN tournaments, but was still unsuccessful after
			a terrible performance at The International 2015.

			Takhasomi then founded 5Jungz, now Team Liquid, which bagged multiple championships such as the EPICENTER
			2016, StarLadder i-League SarSeries Season 3, EPICENTER 2017, The International 2017, and the China Dota 2
			Supermajor.

			He is the first professional Dota 2 player to win 1000 games and play 107 different Heroes in his esports
			career.



			With this list, Dota 2 has taken the charts by storm.

			On the Top 100 highest overall earnings list provided by e-Sports Earnings, 77 are Dota 2 players. The Top
			50 are also dominated by them.

			Counter Strike: Global Offensive managed to register only 16 players.

			The number of representatives from other games are measly: League of Legends (four), Call of Duty: Infinite
			Warfare (two), and StarCraft II (one).</p><br>
